# Models

### This model folder will contain all of the code that defines what data we are working with (its shape, fields, constraints)

### Establishes a shared language for the domain (e.g., “an Incident has a title, a timestamp, a severity”)

### The model represents your core business concept. Everything else — controllers, services, repositories — will revolve around that model.

### In other words: the model is the blueprint
